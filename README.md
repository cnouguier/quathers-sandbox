# quathers-sandbox
My sandbox to learn how to develop applications based on Quasar and Feathers frameworks:
* http://quasar-framework.org/
* https://feathersjs.com/

The exercises carried out within this sandbox are based on the tutorial realized by my guru ['Lucky' Claustres](https://github.com/claustres) : https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial.
