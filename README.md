# quathers-sandbox
My sandbox to learn how to develop applications based on Quasar and Feathers frameworks:
* **Quasar Framework** (http://quasar-framework.org/)
* **Feathers** (https://feathersjs.com/)

The exercises carried out within this sandbox are based on the tutorial realized by my guru ['Lucky' Claustres](https://github.com/claustres) : https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial. 

## Requirements
The following softwares are required to build and run the code:
* **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/) : No need to present Node.js however a version greather than v7.x is requested. To help manage Node.js versions, it is recommended to use **NVM** (https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
* **Yarn** (https://yarnpkg.com) : A powerful dependency manager.
